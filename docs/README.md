# Documentation

This folder contains the documentation of the project. It is currently working in progress.

## Building the documentation

TypeScript documentation that is built from master is available to browse at https://awesome-schedule.github.io/docs/tsdoc/

### TypeScript

> Note: if you don't have typedoc installed, you can install it globally by `npm install -g typedoc`

You can build the documentation for typescript files by running

```bash
npm run tsdoc
```

### Vue

Currently I don't know a good way to extract comments in single file components. If you find a way, you're more than welcome to submit a pull request.
